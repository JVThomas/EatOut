#EatOut

EatOut is a Rails/AngularJS app that I made for my final project in the Learn-Verified Program. It's a basic event planner that allows users to select a venue through the Foursquare API, plan details around it (name, date, time, notes, dates) and save the event to a database. The user is free to delete or edit the event at any time should the need arise.
